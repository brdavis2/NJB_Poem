Golden

The sun shines radiant in the springtime
The river glints the light off the water
Reflecting the gold back at Noelle
Onto her golden hair

Not Ashy

The train goes by
Pushing gray flakes into the air
Flies through the sky
Onto her hair--not ashy

Strawberry

We ride through the country
On horseback we go
Past the patch of wild strawberries
Whose color tinges her hair

Darkening

We ride through the countryside
The sun's golden orb departs
Nighttime comes out
Whose hue is mixed with her hair
